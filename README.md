<h3> Running Application </h3>

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

After that you need to install vscode extensions to help us keep a clean code (project pattern).

Enable ESLint:

`https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`

Disable Extension:

For this project is recommended disable the Prettier - Code Formatter extension to prevent incompatibility, becasuse te prettier is already setted on environment.

If you are using Windows Enable EditorConfig for VS Code:

`https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig`

After finish all configurations you can run to start the project:

`yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev`

You could run the node, postgres and adminer using the docker file.
To run the docker file is easy if you have the docker and docker-compose installed.
